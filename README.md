# Web CV

This project is a CV written in React. I wanted to re-create the CV I made in photoshop. The problem
with a CV designed in PhotoShop is that it is very difficult and annoying to maintain. Making CV's
in Microsoft Word is also very difficult to make something that looks unique and stands out.

Therefore, I made this React app. It is a simple static page that can be "printed" as a PDF and
shared around like any other CV. Only written in HTML and SCSS, using React.
